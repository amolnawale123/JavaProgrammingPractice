Those who are coming out on the streets without any reasons will be badly beaten by the police and will also be put behind the bars. The Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May.  Extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3 will inflict an economic loss of USD 234.4 billion, and result in stagnant GDP for calendar year 2020, a British brokerage said on Tuesday. The economic growth will be zero for calendar year 2020 and when seen from a fiscal year perspective, will rise 0.8 per cent in 2021, brokerage Barclays said in a note.";
